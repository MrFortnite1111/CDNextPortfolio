    title: "Cosmic Design Portfolio Site: Complete!",
    date: "2025-04-20",
    content: `YESS!!! It is finally completed! After hours upon hours, time spent through 3 weekends, my Portfolio Website is finally complete, just the way I like it!

### So... What's New?
Well, uh... there's a balance of not much but just enough to be quite different! There are now actual design portfolio galleries to check out my most proudest works yet, overhauling the blog layout, and much more. Aside from that, I also did some cleanup of the code on the backend and frontend now that I have a better understanding of NextJS and Javascript (still not a whole lot, but it'll get me by for the time being lol)

As for any more announcements. Check back on the blog every Tuesday to see what I gotta say! This can include a highlight of recent or big projects I worked on, more info about Bygone Lands, and some fun personal stuff in general. This is genuinely a good place to better understand my creative mindset and processes when it comes to designing, so stay tuned!`,

    title: "Brave the Unknown: Bygone Lands",
    date: "2024-03-17",
    content: `Howdy folks, and welcome back to my art blog. Today's post is all about going into the little details in crafting my recent artwork for my graphic novel, [“Bygone Lands.”](comic-page.html#paper-adventures) This novel has been in the works for 6 years (Man, time flies by!) and I'm super excited to finally be able to finish it this Fall after all this time. Anyways, one must wonder how I made this pleasant little cover, and I'll tell you just that!

### What's Bygone Lands all about?
This story is all about exploration, as our protagonists hear about the legends of a world filled to the brim with imaginations that span into infinity, beginning their adventures into an old and forgotten civilization. Once I had a good description of my story, I started thinking about how I wanted to present it to my audience cohesively. It needs to be gripping, enticing, and initiating curiosity in reading such a mysterious novel.

### Ideas to Cover
Moving to the second step, I had to find out how I could compact all of that into one presentable cover. I sifted through the page sketches of my graphic novel, finding the “moment” that I want to represent as my graphic novel cover. Soon, I landed on said moment, which is when the protagonists are swept away to a forgotten civilization. Traveling through this mysterious portal, streaks of light fly around the air and the skies of both worlds seep into the portal stream. It was such a fun and miraculous way to describe and picture in my head that I had to sketch out that moment!

This is where the fun begins! I started sketching out some thumbnails for the cover and eventually moved to the big sketch with my perfect thumbnail. It was originally going to be the protagonists floating in the portal stream with the rifts opening up, but I thought the sketch was still too empty. Then, my gears started turning, thinking about the details of world building as a whole! Eventually, I added sky lanterns into the mix of illustrations, as a means of representing the festival's culture in the novel with wishes sent to the other side to become a reality.

### Time for Illustrating!!
With my sketch completed, I began to work on Procreate where I ink and color in the artwork. Getting used to the software and using each stroke elegantly, this was an art piece I had the most fun in while challenging myself critically in making choices in this artwork.

The biggest challenges were drawing the building structures in the portal rifts and balancing my contrast of colors. I'm not all that proficient in drawing buildings, but this artwork is giving me a push into diving into that category, along with strengthening my color choices. Regardless of these challenges, the aspects that I had the most fun with outshine my struggles, with parts such as the unity of the elements in the cover art and the entire spectacle of the finished product.

In short, this cover has seen many renditions and hard challenges in the process, but the overall result is so satisfying to see and compare to my previous covers! I'm still very excited about the progress I've made on my graphic novel after all these years and am looking forward to wrapping it all up!

    title: "My Experience with Vanilla JS and React JS",
    date: "2024-03-12",
    content: `My experience with developing both To-Do apps was quite interesting, realizing the complexities of both Vanilla JavaScript and React JS are more difficult to understand when being used to HTML and CSS.

When working with Vanilla JavaScript and React JS separately, I understood that Vanilla JavaScript is more structurally complex than React JS. The reason for this is that Vanilla JS needs more lines of code and specific codes that call out a function that you want to make a feature. React JS, on the other hand, is defined as a JavaScript library. This means that React JS can use simple lines of code and knows the feature you're using, making it more organized and structurally simplistic, compared to the more backbone structured Vanilla JS with infinite variables.

The reusability of components between the two JS software is similar but very different in how the structure looks. Vanilla JS is able to reuse components, but the code needs to be made first at the bottom and requires another a line of callout code to reuse such components. For React JS, the process is similar but the callout is much easier as the code is more simplistic and easier for the eye to understand, making the code smaller but carrying the same effect as Vanilla JS would.

When learning and developing with both JavaScript apps, it was still hard to understand the complex lines of code and implement them into the website. I will admit that React JS is a little easier to understand once you played around with Vanilla JS, but I only had to use a template with the React JS code so I can't really say the difference in the learning curve. However, as I tinker more with these two apps, I'm willing to bet I'll get a better understanding of the functionality of both.

In the User Interface and User Experience world, React JS definitely is much easier to read and understand than Vanilla JS, with the more organized code and simple callouts. React JS is a lot more responsive when editing the code and seeing it updated in real time, along with their simplistic code.

In short, React JS is more user friendly and design-friendly, but Vanilla JS is necessary in understanding the implementation of JavaScript on your website.

Since my finals have eaten away at my soul for quite a while now, I decided to take the time to relax and draw some artwork for an online art contest called Puqween! I had quite a lot of fun drawing their characters and mine in these illustrations, playing around with the rendering and more color schemes. Again, I'm super proud of how these all turned out!`,

I decided I haven't drawn this sweet and funny fellow in quite a while and wanted to see how he stands in my modern style! I adore the posing here as it feels more fluid and an improvement from my earlier stiff poses. The rendering was also pretty awesome, good to know that I'm very much improving!

This is Meatball, a fun but dumb fry cook! Once a renowned chef who worked with his brother, now alone in a taco stand and left in obscurity. In this artwork, he still shows passion and love when cooking up food for his customers. It's enough to remind him of the good old days of working professionally with his brother. For now, he has to keep up his small business or swim in a sea of debt.`,

Seeing the happy warrior's pride and smile, the warm and bright colors giving me hope, I powered through this and am truly proud to see the final work. This probably cemented, for me, that Harberd is one of my favorite original characters to make and draw.`,

Grazing the untamed lands and dirt roads, Harberd the Divine is a traveling paladin who seeks to share the holy word through glory of battle. Wielding his trusty halberd and his heart, painted with glossy gold, nothing can stop this warrior's boisterous spirit!`,

I'm really glad with how this turned out, it makes me happy to see how my art has come this far. I'm happy with how the colors and the rendering came together nicely to form a beautiful display, really lived up to how I pictured it in my head!

Introducing Marsha, the Ivy Queen! A lone bard who creates chaos wherever she plays, she is one trouble maker who carries outstanding performances to the masses. She usually performs by conjuring up an instrument through her spells and playing as she pleases.

It's not known how she causes chaos in each performance, but many have seen a bloom of darkness spreading across the sky during her performances. Though an outcast due to her sorcery origins, she steals the hearts of those who love her shows!`,

A sorceress bard who travels to different towns to stir up the crowds in a mosh pit like concert. I definitely enjoy seeing where this current artwork is heading, so make sure to keep an eye out for more progress logs like these! Have a good evening, everyone!`,
